# ML_Workshop
A workshop on Machine-Learning methods for the STFC beginning PhD student summer school at Keele University

This repository consists of a number of Jupyter notebooks and a presentation to be used during a workshop
on machine-learning methods.

RFClassification_Student.ipynb
*  A notebook that you can run along with me to demonstrate various features of coding

RFStellar_Classifier_Student.ipynb
*  An exercise for you to try based on classification of SDSS sources. A "solution" will follow.

data
*  a folder containing some example datasets

Intro-to-Machine-learning.pptx
* a brief powerpoint to be used at the session with some attached notes

# Installation and Use

Click on the dropdown menu "<> Code" and select "Download ZIP".

Unzip this to a location that your Jupyter notebook installation can see it.

That's it.

If using Google Colab rather than Jupyter notebboks, then you will need to upload the .ipynb files and the .csv files in the data/ folder to Colab separately. You will then need to work out what the "path" is to te data and change the relevant line in the .ipynb files to upload the data from the correct place.
